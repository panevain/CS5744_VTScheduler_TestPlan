In addition to the integration tests, you also need to plan validation tests. Your validation tests should be organized around a traceability matrix that maps your validation test case skeletons to the requirements for the project. You can think of this section as just one more "test procedure for a build", but this time the build is the entire system.

requirements established as part of requirements modeling are validated against the software that has been constructed

Integration testing is a systematic technique for constructing the software architecture while at the same time conducting tests to uncover errors associated with interfacing. The objective is to take unit-tested components and build a program structure that has been dictated by design.
