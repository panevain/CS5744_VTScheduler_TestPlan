description of the tests planned for each integration build

For each separate phase/build you identified in your test plan, you need to describe a specific test procedure. This should include a brief description of the main purpose of the build (i.e., which specific functional/performance/design characteristics are to be tested here), and a listing of the specific test case skeletons for the test cases you have planned to perform. There is no need to choose specific test data; instead, you can simply describe the form or structure of the test case (those details will be refined later in the life cycle), such as specifying the series of actions to carry out or the series of steps to take. In addition, for each build's test procedure, you should briefly describe the overhead software (drivers, stubs, etc.) that will have to be constructed in order to perform the tests you have planned.
