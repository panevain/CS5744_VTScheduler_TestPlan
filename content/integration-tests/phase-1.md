Phase one of integration testing does not directly check any functional requirement, but instead supports later phases of integration testing by verifying that objects can be written to and read from the MongoDB instance. Phase one aims to test the bi-directional dataflow between the backend and database. This requires creating a test stub which issues commands commands from the backend to the database and measures the responses received.
