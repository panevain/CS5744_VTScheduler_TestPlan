Plan for integration builds

Devise and present a series of integration phases and corresponding partial system builds for incrementally testing identifiable pieces of the system. You need to present the phases, describe what portions of the system each one contains, and then give a brief argument for why this is the best way to carry out the integration testing for the design you have chosen. For projects of the size pursued in this class, a handfull (3-5) phases may be appropriate, but you are welcome to divide phases into subphases if that seems necessary for the project you have chosen.
