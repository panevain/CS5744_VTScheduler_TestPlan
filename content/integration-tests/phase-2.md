Phase 2 of integration testing will be adding in the backend functionality to the toolies and database system that has already been constructed. The tests for this phase will be focused on ensuring that the current system interacts with the backend correctly, that the API methods that connect the backend, toolies, and database function correctly, and that the system handles concurrent actions correctly. For each test, care must be taken to ensure that the actions are occuring through the toolies, with the toolies handling all interaction with the database, rather than the backend directly accessing it. Additionally, to satisfy NFR-2 and NFR-3, each of the tests must execute and produced the expected outcomes in less than 1 second.
