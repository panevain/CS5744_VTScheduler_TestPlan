As stated in the VT Scheduler *User Interface (HL4)* section:

> The user interface to be implemented will not be overly complicated to the user.
> Most of the processing will be done with the web user interface sending/requesting
> data to the toolies such as login/logout toolie, course filter toolie (i.e., Course
> Status, Campus, Levels, Term, and Parts of Term), add courses toolie, and a toolie
> for displaying the schedule. All the toolies will interact with the appropriate abstract
> data structures not seen by the users, but the data the users interact with will be
> executed and taken from the interface to the system and will be updated based on an
> event-based approach.

That being said, the user interface will be the primary method of interaction with the system and therefore is an important
component to test.

**Phase three** of integration testing incorporates ensuring the interfaces for both students and administrators function as expected.
This means that his phase of testing will span from the web interface to the backend and database. That is, the methodology that the
frontend uses to dispatch calls to the backend will be tested to ensure that the correct calls are being made in the correct scenarios.

This ensures that, as users interact with the frontend UI, the correct calls are being made to the backend. Furthermore, this testing
will ensure that the format and contents of the responses from the backend are as expected. This will test for unexpected or undesired
behaviors end-to-end.
