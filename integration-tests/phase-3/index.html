Most of the processing will be done with the web user interface sending/requesting data to the toolies such as login/logout toolie, course filter toolie (i.e., Course Status, Campus, Levels, Term, and Parts of Term), add courses toolie, and a toolie for displaying the schedule. All the toolies will interact with the appropriate abstract data structures not seen by the users, but the data the users interact with will be executed and taken from the interface to the system and will be updated based on an event-based approach.</blockquote><p>That being said, the user interface will be the primary method of interaction with the system and therefore is an important component to test.<p><strong>Phase three</strong> of integration testing incorporates ensuring the interfaces for both students and administrators function as expected. This means that his phase of testing will span from the web interface to the backend and database. That is, the methodology that the frontend uses to dispatch calls to the backend will be tested to ensure that the correct calls are being made in the correct scenarios.<p>This ensures that, as users interact with the frontend UI, the correct calls are being made to the backend. Furthermore, this testing will ensure that the format and contents of the responses from the backend are as expected. This will test for unexpected or undesired behaviors end-to-end.<h2 id=standard-user-student>Standard User (Student)</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Test Case ID<th>Test Objective<th>Test Description<th>Expected Results<tbody><tr><td>I3.1a<td>Ensure users can add courses via the UI (without force add)<td>Click on the “Add Course” button on the student home page, fill out course information (<strong>without</strong> selecting force add), submit course addition<td>UI receives an <code>OK</code> response and course has been successfully added to the corresponding student’s course list via the backend calling <code>enrollCourse forceAdd=false</code>.<tr><td>I3.1b<td>Ensure users can add courses via the UI (with force add)<td>Click on the “Add Course” button on the student home page, fill out course information (<strong>selecting</strong> force add), submit course addition<td>UI receives an <code>OK</code> response and course has been successfully added to the corresponding student’s course list via the backend calling <code>enrollCourse forceAdd=true)</code>.<tr><td>I3.1c<td>Test behavior when a student attempts to add a course they have previously added<td>Click on the “Add Course” button on the student home page, fill out course information with a course that has already been added, submit course addition<td>UI receives a <code>CONFLICT</code> response and course enrollment has not been duplicated in the database, UI notifies the user appropriately.<tr><td>I3.2a<td>Ensure users can unenroll from courses via the UI<td>Click on the “Remove Course” button on the student home page, fill in the course CRN, submit course unenrollment<td>UI receives an <code>OK</code> response and the student has been successfully unenrolled from the course via the backend calling <code>unenrollCourse</code>.<tr><td>I3.2b<td>Test behavior when a student attempts to unenroll from a course they are not enrolled in<td>Click on the “Remove Course” button on the student home page, fill in the course CRN that the user is not enrolled in, submit course unenrollment<td>UI receives a <code>NOT_FOUND</code> response, no action is taken in the database, and the UI notifies the user appropriately.<tr><td>I3.3a<td>Ensure users can search courses by CRN<td>Click on the “Search” button, enter the CRN to be searched, submit search<td>UI receives an <code>OK</code> response along with a JSON list containing all courses with that CRN via the backend calling <code>search</code>.
