The tests for this phase will be focused on ensuring that the current system interacts with the backend correctly, that the API methods that connect the backend, toolies, and database function correctly, and that the system handles concurrent actions correctly. For each test, care must be taken to ensure that the actions are occuring through the toolies, with the toolies handling all interaction with the database, rather than the backend directly accessing it. Additionally, to satisfy NFR-2 and NFR-3, each of the tests must execute and produced the expected outcomes in less than 1 second.<h1 id=api-tests>API Tests</h1><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Test Case ID</strong><th><strong>Test Objective</strong><th><strong>Test Description</strong><th><strong>Expected Results</strong><tbody><tr><td>I2.1a<td>Check the interface link between the enrollCourse API and the database<td>Send Post request with student, course, and forceAdd: false.<td>Response 200 (Request was successful) and course has been successfully added to the corresponding studentâ€™s course list using the Add/Drop Course toolie.<tr><td>I2.1b<td>Check the interface link between the enrollCourse with forceAdd API and the database<td>Send Post request with student, course, and forceAdd: true.<td>Response 200 (Request was successful) and course has been successfully added to the corresponding studentâ€™s course list using the Add/Drop Course toolie.<tr><td>I2.2<td>Check the interface link between the unenrollCourse API and the database<td>Send Post request with student and CRN.<td>Response 200 (Request was successful) and course with corresponding CRN has been successfully removed from the corresponding studentâ€™s course list using the Add/Drop Course toolie.<tr><td>I2.3a<td>Check the interface link between the searchCourse by CRN API and the database<td>Send Post request with CRN.<td>Response 200 (Request was successful) and a JSON object containing all courses with that CRN is returned using the Course information toolie.<tr><td>I2.3b<td>Check the interface link between the searchCourse by subject API and the database<td>Send Post request with subject.<td>Response 200 (Request was successful) and a JSON object containing all courses with that subject is returned using the Course information toolie.<tr><td>I2.3c<td>Check the interface link between the searchCourse by timeslot API and the database<td>Send Post request with timeslot.<td>Response 200 (Request was successful) and a JSON object containing all courses with that timeslot is returned using the Course information toolie.<tr><td>I2.4<td>Check the interface link between the viewCourses API and the database<td>Send Post request with student<td>Response 200 (Request was successful) and studentâ€™s course list has been fetched from the database using the Generated Schedule toolie and returned as a JSON.<tr><td>I2.5<td>Check the interface link between the addCourse API and the database<td>Send Post request with newCourse<td>Response 200 (Request was successful) and newCourse record has been created in the database using the Authorized Access toolie.<tr><td>I2.6<td>Check the interface link between the deleteCourse API and the database<td>Send Post request with CRN<td>Response 200 (Request was successful) and course record with corresponding CRN has been removed from the database using the Authorized Access toolie.</table></div></div><div class=prev-link><a class=previous href=https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_VTScheduler_TestPlan/integration-tests/phase-1/><</a></div><div class=next-link><a class=next href=https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_VTScheduler_TestPlan/integration-tests/phase-3/>></a></div></div><script src=https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_VTScheduler_TestPlan/elasticlunr.min.js></script><script src=https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_VTScheduler_TestPlan/search_index.en.js></script><script src=https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_VTScheduler_TestPlan/book.js></script>
